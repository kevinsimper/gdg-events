We already see lots of teams moving to this very promising language. But in JetBrains we just don't want to stop on that. So we are working on Kotlin.Native, the same language, different backend. And one of the most promising applications for this backend is iOS development.</p> <p>In this talk I'll do short introduction into Kotlin language itself with description of some high level design ideas. Next step will be discussions around Native as a platform. I'll show you current complications with it and possible solutions. And finally we will go to iOS. You will see cross compiled Android/iOS example as well as example with just shared business logic. As a bonus I'll show you infinite possibilities about single language with all the parts, backend, frontend and two mobile apps.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>My name is Alexander Podkhalyuzin. I work for JetBrains from 2008 and 9 years I spent working on Scala plugin for IntelliJ IDEA. Last year I decided to go further and switched to Kotlin team, I started working on Kotlin.Native support in CLion and finished leading Kotlin tooling team, which includes general Kotlin support in IntelliJ IDEA and other IDEs.<br/>Before JetBrains I studied math quite successfully. That was one of my touches with Vilnius as I participated in Baltic Way math competition, where our team from St. Petersburg won. And that's not the all about my connection to the Lithuania as my mother born in Lithuania and Lithuanian is my second mother tongue language. So I'll try to do this talk in Lithuanian, the first time in my life, I hope it will be fun, so see you in Vilnius!</p> <p>Warm-up talk:<br/>Cross-Platform Knowledge<br/>Eligijus Starinskas (Trafi), Justas Medeišis (Trafi)</p> <p>At a lean startup with separate native Android and iOS apps and only a handful of mobile developers, we have explored both technical and human approaches to minimize duplicate work - thin clients, a shared C++ library, cross-functional teams. This experience has led us to a new standard for collaboration across Android and iOS developers inspired by domain-driven design. By working closely we 'steal' code from the other platform and do most of the work once without sacrificing the native language and development toolkit of each platform.</p> <p>This talk explores the challenges and benefits of collaborating closely across Android and iOS.<br/>- Common constraints on both mobile platforms, and what Android developers can learn from iOS community solutions.<br/>- Core similarities and differences between Kotlin and Swift, and how the languages help bridge communication across the two platforms.<br/>- Work practices and code principles that reduce the friction of cross-platform knowledge sharing.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1525325335000,"duration":10800000,"id":"250401310","name":"Google IO 2018 Extended - Vilnius","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1525797000000,"local_date":"2018-05-08","local_time":"19:30","updated":1526062799000,"utc_offset":10800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":100,"venue":{"id":25824630,"name":"Wix, Vinted and Swedbank IT HQ offices","lat":54.683223724365234,"lon":25.28602409362793,"repinned":false,"address_1":"3 great IT offices (see description)","city":"Vilnius","country":"lt","localized_country_name":"Lithuania"},"group":{"created":1512819919000,"name":"GDG Vilnius","id":26825483,"join_mode":"open","lat":54.70000076293945,"lon":25.270000457763672,"urlname":"GDG-Vilnius","who":"Members","localized_location":"Vilnius, Lithuania","state":"","country":"lt","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Vilnius"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Vilnius/events/250401310/","description":"<p>Doors open: 19:30<br/>Stream starts: 20:00</p> <p>Locations:<br/>- Wix (Didžioji g. 28, 3rd floor, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/TxzrGzL1RkQ2\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/maps/TxzrGzL1RkQ2</a>, timelapse: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1039858902838831/permalink/1041942785963776/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/events/1039858902838831/permalink/1041942785963776/</a>)<br/>- Vinted HQ (Žirmūnų g. 70, 7th floor, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/moQ4AhduHxS2\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/maps/moQ4AhduHxS2</a>, timelapse: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1039858902838831/permalink/1041943559297032/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/events/1039858902838831/permalink/1041943559297032/</a>)<br/>- Swedbank IT HQ (Perkūnkiemio g. 5, 2nd floor, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/LZX8c51x67L2\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/maps/LZX8c51x67L2</a>, video: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1039858902838831/permalink/1041942135963841/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/events/1039858902838831/permalink/1041942135963841/</a>)</p> <p>We are inviting you to Google I/O 2018 Keynote live-streaming event.

Šarūnas is also the chairman of the board at the Lithuanian Game Developers Association, which helps local game developers meet, share their knowledge and learn.</p> <p>Gintaras Jakimavičius- Passionate games and experienced mobile apps developer. He has been developing for mobile platforms for more than 8 years (iOS, Android, Unity). Mobile development is such a new area that being an early adopter is a must. Last couple of years working as a freelancer allowed to stay on the top of innovation chain (cross-platform with ReactNative, ML, AR). Gintaras will share about AR from a different side - as most experience comes from iOS platform and applying ML on mobile.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1555661894000,"duration":10800000,"id":"260754003","name":"I/O Extended 2019 Vilnius","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1557244800000,"local_date":"2019-05-07","local_time":"19:00","updated":1557261971000,"utc_offset":10800000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":96,"venue":{"id":25656566,"name":"Wix new office","lat":54.67825698852539,"lon":25.28765106201172,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Didžioji g. 28 Vilnius 01128","city":"Vilnius","country":"lt","localized_country_name":"Lithuania"},"group":{"created":1512819919000,"name":"GDG Vilnius","id":26825483,"join_mode":"open","lat":54.70000076293945,"lon":25.270000457763672,"urlname":"GDG-Vilnius","who":"Members","localized_location":"Vilnius, Lithuania","state":"","country":"lt","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Vilnius"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Vilnius/events/260754003/","description":"<p>Doors open: 19:30<br/>Stream starts: 20:00</p> <p>Locations:<br/>- Trafi HQ (Rinktinės g. 5, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/u4K3HVkYZKhAwE1XA\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/maps/u4K3HVkYZKhAwE1XA</a>)<br/>- Wix (Didžioji g. 28, 3rd floor, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/TxzrGzL1RkQ2\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/maps/TxzrGzL1RkQ2</a>)<br/>- SERMO (Perkūnkiemio g. 7, 6th floor, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/5xwqo9DXTDVBknS26\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/maps/5xwqo9DXTDVBknS26</a>)<br/>SERMO has limited seating, please confirm before arrival [masked]</p> <p>We are inviting you to Google I/O 2019 Keynote live-streaming event.

WebAssembly provides another way, as a low-level language similar to assembly, with a compact binary format. The power of WebAssembly lies in the ability for it to be a compilation target for a range of statically typed languages like C, C++, Rust, Go and even TypeScript.</p> <p>The rise of WebAssembly support in browsers has allowed companies such as AutoCad and Figma to rethink their web applications, games engines such as Unity to turbo power their libraries and even consumer sites like eBay to improve their user experience.</p> <p>The real question on everyone's minds is, will it cause a paradigm shift in how we build applications as web developers? This talk will attempt to answer this question by giving a grounding in what WebAssembly is, then dig into its use cases and what the future holds for it. Attendees can expect to understand where WebAssembly lies in the ecosystem and what it provides to those building apps today and how it might change the web going forward.</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1573118439000,"duration":10800000,"id":"266283790","name":"GDG Vilnius: Flutter workshop","rsvp_limit":30,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1574505000000,"local_date":"2019-11-23","local_time":"12:30","updated":1574517705000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":28,"venue":{"id":26599050,"name":"Shift4 Payments Lithuania","lat":54.685970306396484,"lon":25.259653091430664,"repinned":true,"address_1":"A.
