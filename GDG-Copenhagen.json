As a result, several projects and perspectives have shown how the qualities of ML can be used to develop new design tools and relations between designers, technology and end-users.<br/>This talk will present some of these projects and perspectives to demonstrate how new ways of using ML algorithms can facilitate a human-centered design process. A process that both enables quick iterations on the spot, and allows a whole new level of inclusion that invites end-users to creatively engage with technology.</p> <p>About Tore:<br/>Tore Knudsen is an interaction designer and recent graduate from K3, Malmö University. Most of his work explores how we can relate to and interact with technology in new ways. Recently ML has played a big role in his projects, one example being Pour Reception which he, together with his co-creators, has exhibited at CLICK festival in Helsingør and The Conference in Malmö.</p> <p>Live and Machine Learn<br/>The life we live online increasingly informs the way we live offline as well. Businesses live and die through algorithms like SEO, humans are sorted in government systems, and we make large, life-governing decisions through what is shown to us on the web: home buying, where to live, what to eat, and who we're in contact with regularly. The first shift we as web developers saw was people living and learning on the web more and more, which excited us. But as we start to automate those tasks through machine learning algorithms, a lot of us have trepidation. We know systems have flaws, what are the political and social consequences?</p> <p>In this talk, we'll explore this paradigm shift and some of it's dangers, but we'll also talk about the good impacts technology can bring. Helping people who need it, automating tasks for humans with disabilities, communication for emergency services: the possibilities for positive influence are endless. We'll explore just some of the tools that are out there, how with a little creativity, we can use these technologies for good. We as developers have a voice and chance to make a difference.<br/>Bio.</p> <p>Friendly regards<br/>Sherry &amp; Cem</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1542919951000,"duration":10800000,"id":"256631866","name":"GDG Copenhagen Christmas edition - Socializing event","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1544115600000,"local_date":"2018-12-06","local_time":"18:00","updated":1544129535000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":13,"venue":{"id":25999292,"name":"Matrikel1 Bar & Café","lat":55.677913665771484,"lon":12.579379081726074,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Gammel Strand 26","city":"København","country":"dk","localized_country_name":"Denmark"},"group":{"created":1448286176000,"name":"GDG Copenhagen","id":19147728,"join_mode":"open","lat":55.68000030517578,"lon":12.569999694824219,"urlname":"GDG-Copenhagen","who":"GDG CPH members","localized_location":"Copenhagen, Denmark","state":"","country":"dk","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Copenhagen"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Copenhagen/events/256631866/","description":"<p>It's nearly the end of the year...</p> <p>This edition is going to be a joint event together with ngCopenhagen and Women Techmacker Copenhagen.</p> <p>So, we would like to invite you to our very casual Christmas gathering where you will get a chance to get together and spend time with members of different communities in Copenhagen.</p> <p>There will be Æbleskiver, Gløgg and drink cards which can be purchased with special discount.</p> <p>Of course, expect loads of fun, quiz &amp; raffles!</p> <p>See you there!</p> <p>Sherry, Cem &amp; Jeppe</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1548666758000,"duration":18000000,"id":"258461521","name":"IWD Copenhagen 2019","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1552062600000,"local_date":"2019-03-08","local_time":"17:30","updated":1552083115000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":12,"group":{"created":1448286176000,"name":"GDG Copenhagen","id":19147728,"join_mode":"open","lat":55.68000030517578,"lon":12.569999694824219,"urlname":"GDG-Copenhagen","who":"GDG CPH members","localized_location":"Copenhagen, Denmark","state":"","country":"dk","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Copenhagen"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Copenhagen/events/258461521/","description":"<p>A group of powerful female leaders from Copenhagen have joined forces to bring you our first Women in Tech Kickoff event for International Women’s Day with a special focus on AI.

We’re excited to announce our next GDG Copenhagen meetup with a very special guest speaker: Gus Maskowitz, Head of Developer Relations, Gospel Technology. Gus will be discussing use cases and best practices for how blockchain and GKE can provide a platform for securely sharing super sensitive data in the cloud.</p> <p>Join us on the 13th November for free food, drinks, swag and a raffle to win a prize! Must be present to win</p> <p>Securing data is an understood task - it’s doable and achievable if you work hard and pay attention. Securing shared data is a mess of all-or-nothing access, contracts and hope: handing over data en mass and hoping it goes well. Gospel Technology has worked out how to solve the problem - we use a blockchain for creating a fool-proof audit log and patented methods for consensus on READING data OUT to ensure reads are always logged and only granted to those with permissions, even as your data extends into a partner organisation, far beyond your access controls and policy enforcing middleware. How? We’ll show you! And help you build ridiculously secure data, PII and other sharing systems to solve real world problems.</p> <p>About the speaker: Gus Maskowitz heads up Gospel Technology’s Developer Relations. As a former Google Developer Advocate and Rackspace engineer, Gus brings over 20 years of development and tech experience, with a passion for emerging technologies. Gospel Technology is a secure distributed database built on a private permissioned blockchain that enables organisations to retain complete control of their shared data – even when it’s been shared externally.
