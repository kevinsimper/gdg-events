This way, you can build something in an area that you care about or are interested in.</p> <p>• HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE<br/>One in-person session of 3 hours, followed by 2-8 hours of self-study.</p> <p>• WHAT IS THE END RESULT<br/>This event series is targeting all levels of developers and we hope to see some great Actions on Google come out as a result and all of you having a ton of fun exploring what you can do with Google Assistant. We’ll provide you with content to learn how to create and actually build Actions on Google. Actions will be featured online and may even be showcased at the Google I/O Community Lounge.</p> <p>• IMPORTANT TO BRING<br/>Bring a laptop (PC, Mac or Chromebook)!
