By attending this class with your cross-functional team, you will learn basic user-centered design processes and how to apply them throughout your entire product development cycle.</p> <p>We will cover the process of taking product ideas from concept to launch, including sketching, user testing, prototyping, and making continuous improvements after launch to keep your users engaged and satisfied.</p> <p>Meet Our Instructors :<br/>Ahmed Sobhy ( Google Developer Expert and UX instructor )<br/>Nasser Ali ( UX instructor )<br/>Carine Teyrouz ( UX instructor )</p> <p>Registration : <a href=\"https://events.withgoogle.com/ux-masterclass-powered-bygdg/\" class=\"linkified\">https://events.withgoogle.com/ux-masterclass-powered-bygdg/</a></p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1558269261000,"duration":9000000,"id":"261588638","name":"Cloud Next’19 Extended: Machine Learning Fundamentals","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1560603600000,"local_date":"2019-06-15","local_time":"15:00","updated":1561552191000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":30,"venue":{"id":26450034,"name":"Ideaspace BORG","lat":30.851442337036133,"lon":29.56897735595703,"repinned":false,"address_1":"حوض سكرة وأبو حمد","city":"قسم برج العرب","country":"eg","localized_country_name":"Egypt"},"group":{"created":1518951371000,"name":"GDG Cloud Egypt","id":27560492,"join_mode":"open","lat":30.059999465942383,"lon":31.25,"urlname":"GDG-Cloud-Egypt","who":"Members","localized_location":"Cairo, Egypt","state":"","country":"eg","region":"en_US","timezone":"Africa/Cairo"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Cloud-Egypt/events/261588638/","manual_attendance_count":22,"description":"<p>Making sense of a messy world!</p> <p>Machine learning is a powerful tool for solving problems and making sense of the messy repeatable data around us.</p> <p>Hard logical rules are not the way to solve really interesting real-world problems, there's a whole raft of different approaches and in fact, it's probably not one technique for everything, it's a bunch of different techniques and combinations of them.</p> <p>Cloud Next’19 Extended: Machine Learning Fundamentals will include some of those techniques and helping you to take your first steps in ML:</p> <p>1- Why Machine Learning?<br/>2- Supervised Learning<br/>3- Unsupervised Learning<br/>4- Reinforcement Learning<br/>5- Why deep learning and how it's different from ML.</p> <p>This session is suitable for you as a participant, if:</p> <p>You are a strong programmer.<br/>You have fundamental concepts about statistics.<br/>You know at least a little about linear algebra and calculus.<br/>You are somewhat familiar with Python.
