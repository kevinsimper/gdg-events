The presentation will focus on the differences in building the UI and the learning curve for each platform. Silouanos will then demonstrate good and bad practices often followed in each platform.</p> <p>In the second part of this presentation, Silouanos will talk about how a programmer can utilise the new Android's programming language, Kotlin, to build shared code for the two platforms.</p> <p>18:00 Doors Open<br/>18:30 Talk starts<br/>19:30 Meet &amp; Greet</p> <p>p.s.
