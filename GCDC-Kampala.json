Build modern web and mobile applications on an open cloud platform: bring your own language runtimes, frameworks, and third party libraries. Google App Engine is a fully managed platform that completely abstracts away infrastructure so you focus only on code. Go from zero to planet-scale and see why some of today’s most successful companies power their applications on App Engine.</p> <p>Are you a developer or interested in programing using Cloud technologies? Join us on 28th March 2018 at Outbox technology hub as we introduce to you the Google Cloud Platform and the new community.
